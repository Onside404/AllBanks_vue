            <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__text">It happens that the owners or future buyers of the house do not know on what foundation it stands. I did an examination of a two-story house made of gas blocks. The customer said that the foundation was a slab on stilts, but it turned out that there was no slab on the floor, there was just sand, a film on it, then Penoplex thermal insulation, and a semi-dry screed was poured on top. Therefore, there is no concrete below.</p>

            <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__text">Perhaps the structure has a right to exist; people used to live with an earthen floor, but they did not rest reinforced concrete stairs on it. The risk of such a foundation for a reinforced concrete staircase is that it will sag and ruin the finishing in the corridor. To the point where it bursts.</p>

            <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__text">You can save on everything except the foundation. But if you want to save on it, you need to build light, movable walls - for example, frame ones. If the wall is solid, the foundation must be appropriate: with pre-made geology, calculations, cushion, reinforcement and concreting.</p>
            <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__text">You can use LVL timber - made of laminated veneer. If you install one like this as a floor joist in a small house, the floor will be much stiffer.</p>
            <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__text">I recently went to see a facility of a company that had previously not been known for its high-quality construction: the spans were four meters long, the floors sagged by about eight centimeters. I was already preparing to disappoint the customer, but when I arrived, I saw that the contractors had started using LVL beams, and I made the customer happy that the floor would be rigid.</p>

            <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__text"> definitely do not recommend building walls from polystyrene concrete. I read a lot about its shortcomings, did an examination of such houses twice and was personally convinced that the walls made of polystyrene concrete would have cracks.</p>
            <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__text">It is especially important to monitor the walls in frame houses, since there a lot depends on the quality of the assembly. There are two main recommendations:</p>

                <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__list--element__text">Build from dry planed lumber. Some use wood with natural moisture content, but this is essentially wet firewood. In a year they will shrink by 10-15% - and there will be gaps in the frame. The structure will lose its rigidity, and the walls and floors will be blown through.</p>

                <p class="artickle__wrapper--box__content--answer__list--element__text">Take more insulation. In the central part of Russia, the density of insulation should be at least 35 kg per 1 m3. Inexpensive insulation, as a rule, has a density of 12 to 22 kg per 1 m3. Low-density insulation usually comes in rolls; a denser one cannot be rolled into a roll - it is sold in slabs.</p>
